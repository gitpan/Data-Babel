Revision history for Data-Babel

1.11	2013-06-18 - external changes since 1.10
	New features
	- can specify history in IdType, rather than just in Master
	- new 'show_schema_graph' method
	Bug fixes
	- in 'validate', check for unmatched ids has to be case insensitive 
	  because MySQL does case intensive comparisons, e.g., searching for 
	  'htt' as gene_symbol
    	- detect isolated IdTypes, ie, IdTypes not contained in any MapTable.
          previously, load_implicit_masters would generate illegal empty query

1.11_05 2013-06-15
	RC2 for 1.11
	Bug fixes (tests)
	- select_ur was setting status field to undef (should be 0) when invalid
	  input id was not lower case. bug introduced by support for case
	  insensitive comparisons in 1.11_01
	Improved tests
	- added 036.validate_case to test case insensitive validate
	- added tests for case insensitive non-matching ids in 112.validate_case

1.11_04 2013-06-14

1.10	2012-12-02
	New features
	* new 'translate' options
	  - filters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* new methods
	  - load_implicit_masters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* histories
	    Master tables can hold old and current values for ids. translate,
	    count, validate use old values if they exist
	Bug fixes
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids. was generating illegal SQL, now
	  returns empty table
	- examples/babel.pl used deprecated qw(...) as parentheses.  should have
	  been fixed in 1.02.  sorry	
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids would sometimes return NULL id
	- lingering bug in 098.example. test was calling example script with
	  wrong Perl interpreter and without -Mblib. thanks to CPAN smoke 
	  testers for finding this bug!!
	  other scripts. thanks to CPAN testers for finding this problem!
