Revision history for Data-Babel

1.10	2012-11-DD - external changes since 1.03
	New features
	* new 'translate' options
	  - filters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* new methods
	  - load_implicit_masters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* histories
	    Master tables can hold old and current values for ids. translate,
	    count, validate use old values if they exist
	Bug fixes
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids. was generating illegal SQL, now
	  returns empty table
	- examples/babel.pl used deprecated qw(...) as parentheses.  should have
	  been fixed in 1.02.  sorry	
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids would sometimes return NULL id
	- lingering bug in 098.example. test was calling example script with
	  wrong Perl interpreter and without -Mblib. thanks to CPAN smoke 
	  testers for finding this bug!!
----------
1.10_07 2012-11-30
	RC2 for 1.10
	New features
	- expanded 'validate' method to accept output_idtypes
	Bug fixes
	- updated dependencies. should have been done earlier. Class::AutoDB was 
	  1.20 which predates bug fix for redispatch of UNIVERSAL methods on Oid
	  to real object. this caused FAILs in 040 and 050 series, which are the
	  only tests that setup Babel in one script, then do extensive tests in
	  other scripts. thanks to CPAN testers for finding this problem!
