Revision history for Data-Babel

1.12    2013-07-31
	Bug fixes
	- Fixed partial duplicates bug in which translate returned rows that 
	  were identical on all non-null columns, differing only in that one row
	  had nulls where the other had a real value
	Test changes
	- Cleaned up tests to improve CPAN install speed
	- Changed the scheme for telling CPAN that it's futile to run the tests
	  because MySQL is not accessible. I now check key requirements in a 
	  test script and skip out of the test suite if the requirements are not
	  met.  The main requirement that I check is that MySQL be accessible.
	  The test suite reports PASS in this case!! It would be far better to
	  eport NA or UNKNOWN, but I don't know how to do this robustly.
----------
1.11    2013-06-18
	New features
	- can specify history in IdType, rather than just in Master
	- new 'show_schema_graph' method
	Bug fixes
	- in 'validate', check for unmatched ids has to be case insensitive 
	  because MySQL does case intensive comparisons, e.g., searching for 
	  'htt' as gene_symbol
    	- detect isolated IdTypes, ie, IdTypes not contained in any MapTable.
          previously, load_implicit_masters would generate illegal empty query
----------
1.10	2012-12-02
	New features
	* new 'translate' options
	  - filters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* new methods
	  - load_implicit_masters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* histories
	    Master tables can hold old and current values for ids. translate,
	    count, validate use old values if they exist
	Bug fixes
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids. was generating illegal SQL, now
	  returns empty table
	- examples/babel.pl used deprecated qw(...) as parentheses. should have
	  been fixed in 1.02.  sorry	
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids would sometimes return NULL id
	- lingering bug in 098.example. test was calling example script with
	  wrong Perl interpreter and without -Mblib. thanks to CPAN smoke 
	  testers for finding this bug!!
