Revision history for Data-Babel

1.12_05	 2013-07-27
	 RC3
	 Build fixes
	 - Finally trying to fix the longstanding issue that my scheme for
	   telling CPAN that it's futile to run the tests - namely having 
	   Build.PL return 0 and not build the Build script - apparently is not
	   the accepted idiom despite being recommended on some Perl guru site.
	   It may take a few tries to get it right...

1.12_04	 2013-07-21
	 RC2
	 Build fixes
	 - Added Tree::Trie to dependencies. Thanks to CPAN testers
           for finding this!
	 - Updated all dependencies

1.12_03	 2013-07-20
	 RC1
	 New features
	 - Complete implementation of partial duplicate removal
	 - keep_pdups 'translate' option
	 Further test clean up

1.12_02	 2013-07-16
	 Clean up tests to improve install speed

1.12_01	 2013-07-10
	Bug fixes
	- Fixed partial duplicates bug in which translate returned rows
	  that were identical on all non-null columns, differing only
	  in that one row had nulls where the other had a real value
	- This release has initial implementation using prefix hash
----------
1.11    2013-06-18
	New features
	- can specify history in IdType, rather than just in Master
	- new 'show_schema_graph' method
	Bug fixes
	- in 'validate', check for unmatched ids has to be case insensitive 
	  because MySQL does case intensive comparisons, e.g., searching for 
	  'htt' as gene_symbol
    	- detect isolated IdTypes, ie, IdTypes not contained in any MapTable.
          previously, load_implicit_masters would generate illegal empty query
----------
1.10	2012-12-02
	New features
	* new 'translate' options
	  - filters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* new methods
	  - load_implicit_masters
	  - count
	  - validate
	* histories
	    Master tables can hold old and current values for ids. translate,
	    count, validate use old values if they exist
	Bug fixes
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids. was generating illegal SQL, now
	  returns empty table
	- examples/babel.pl used deprecated qw(...) as parentheses. should have
	  been fixed in 1.02.  sorry	
	- 'translate' with empty input_ids would sometimes return NULL id
	- lingering bug in 098.example. test was calling example script with
	  wrong Perl interpreter and without -Mblib. thanks to CPAN smoke 
	  testers for finding this bug!!
----------
