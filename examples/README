This examples directory contains a complete set of configuration files
for creating a Data::Babel.  The files are copies of the one we were
using in our production system at the time we created the example.

The script in this directory, babel.pl, is a very simplified version
of the script we use in production to create and manage our Babels.

The script (like all the tests in the distribution), requires that you
have access to a MySQL database named 'test', with sufficient
permissions to create and drop tables and views, and insert data into
the tables, and select data from the tables and views. It also
requires that you have Class::AutoDB installed (this is a prerequisite
of the module; if you installed Data::Babel via CPAN, Class::AutoDB
should have been installed also).

To run the example, cd to the parent directory and execute the following:

> perl -Mblib examples/babel.pl --create

If all goes well, this will create an AutoDB database containing your
Babel.  It will also print output to the screening showing your Babel
in a human-readable form, and a line saying that check_schema found no
errors.

You can subsequently remake the Babel without recreating the AutoDB
database by running

> perl -Mblib examples/babel.pl --reread

and print the output without remaking the Babel by running

> perl -Mblib examples/babel.pl
